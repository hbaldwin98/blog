# Blog
> A customizable blog written using ASP.NET Core API and Angular. The goal with this project is to create a website that can function as blog, or some form of article posting site, with a minor amount of customizability to allow the creation of a unique blog site. At the moment, there will only be a singular user, the Admin, who will be able to post new articles on the website. Those who access the site can view the articles and comment on each article (the commenter will not have to create an account to comment). This site is created as a learning project for ASP.Net Core API and Angular.
