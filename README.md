# Blog
> A customizable blog written using ASP.NET Core API and Angular. The goal with this project is to create a website that can function as blog, or some form of article posting site. At the moment, there will only be a singular user, the Admin, who will be able to post new articles on the website. Those who access the site can view the articles and comment on each article (the commenter will not have to create an account to comment). This site is created as a learning tool for ASP.Net Core API and Angular.

__Desired Admin Functionalities__
---
1. Name the website from an admin panel
2. Add and delete articles
3. Delete comments
4. Customize the website theme (probably just the color)
5. Add a custom website icon

__Desired Features__
---
_(in no particular order)_
- Searching for articles by name/partial name
- Searching by articles by tags
- Viewing articles by tag(s)
- Ordering articles by date created
